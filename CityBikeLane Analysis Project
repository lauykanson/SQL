# The following are the queries I have completed so far:


--Makea list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher, showing the average safety rating 
for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane". 

WITH temptable as(
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as average_safetyrating
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street
HAVING AVG(safetyrating) >= 4.0
ORDER BY AVG(safetyrating) DESC
)

SELECT street, average_safetyrating, 'Safe Lane' as Label
FROM temptable;

OR

WITH temptable as(
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as average_safetyrating
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street
ORDER BY AVG(safetyrating) DESC
)

SELECT street, average_safetyrating, 'Safe Lane' as Label
FROM temptable
WHERE average_safetyrating >= 4.0;

--A list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed". 

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN "Remove"
ELSE "Improvements Needed"
END Recommendations
